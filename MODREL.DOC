                          DESCRIPTION

    MODREL  (version  1.0)  is  a  program to recover the seventh
character in  external  symbol  names  in  a  "MicroSoft  format"
relocatable object file.

    Although  the  MicroSoft object file format can support seven
character  names,  all  external  names  are  truncated  to   six
characters  in  the  REL  files  produced by the Digital Research
RMAC assembler.  In contrast, other programs such as  Pascal  MT+
generate external  names  of  up to seven characters.  Because of
this difference, seven-character names intended  to  be  commonly
referenced  by a Pascal MT+ program and an RMAC assembly language
program will not be properly resolved.

    Although RMAC truncates names to  six  characters  in  object
files,  it produces a SYM file for debugging purposes which lists
the definition of external symbols, retaining  the  seventh  name
character.   MODREL reads both the REL file and the SYM file, and
uses the symbol information to generate a modified  REL  file  in
which   the   seventh  character  of  external  symbol  names  is
restored.

    MODREL is written in Pascal  for  the  Pascal  MT+  compiler.
The  program  conforms  to  the  IEEE  855-1985  (trial use) MOSI
standard.



                             USAGE

    To use MODREL, ensure that both the REL object file  and  the
SYM  symbol  file  for  the program to be modified, from the same
RMAC execution, are present  on  the  same  disk  drive.    These
should    have   the   names   filename.REL   and   filename.SYM,
respectively.  Run the program by typing:

     A>MODREL filename

where  "filename"  is  the  name  of  your   file   WITHOUT   any
extension.  A  drive specifier may be included.  The program will
process  the  file  to  completion,  placing  its  output  in   a
temporary file   named   filename.$$$.      When   processing  is
successfully completed, the original REL file is deleted and  the
output file  is  renamed  to  filename.REL.    The  SYM  file  is
unchanged.



                        AMBIGUOUS NAMES

    If a program contains two or more external  names  which  are
identical  over  the  first  six  characters,  an  ambiguous case
exists.   It  may  not  be  possible  to  determine  the   proper
extension of  the  truncated  names in the REL file.  MODREL V1.0
detects and reports such ambiguities, but  does  not  change  the
symbol name.   The program could be modified to allow interactive
correction in such cases.



                        MODREL AND MOSI

    MODREL is  a  useful  development  tool  for  the  MOSI  CP/M
interface, version  WVU  1.00.    It  is  also  a MOSI-conforming
program which makes use of some MOSI  functions  although  it  is
not designed  for maximum portability.  Specifically, MODREL uses
MOSI facilities to access command line arguments, read and  write
files,  and  delete  and  rename files at the end of a successful
run.
